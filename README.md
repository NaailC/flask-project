# Fundamental Project: Design and Create a CRUD application
The project is to design, develop and deploy a CRUD application. 

The application must allow the user to CREATE, READ, UPDATE AND DELETE the various fields/sections from a front-end system, that will apply changes directly to the back-end database system.

## Design

This project aims to create a database of Drum and Bass songs by using Flask framework to create a CRUD application.

I will use Flask Framework in order to create the application

I will use Pytest in order to write and use testing scripts

I will use a mysql-database hosted on GCP to store data for my CRUD application

I will use HTML & Jinja2 in order to create a front-end to my application. 

I will use Jenkins in order to continuously test and integrate coding in my application.

The final application will have 2 tables, which will have a many-to-one relationship

### User Stories 
* As a DnB DJ, I would like to access lists of the back catalogues of artists I like
* As someone looking to get into DnB, I would like to find new music
* As someone who enjoys DnB, I would like to find new artists to listen to
* As someone who listens to DnB, I would like to be able to update the database with new songs so other people can enjoy listening to them
* As a user of the DnB Database, I would like to delete songs which are not DnB 
 
## Python

I will be coding my application to work using Python 3.9, as well as various plugins which will create, maintain and update the website.

## Flask Framework 

I will be using Flask Framework in order to create my application. Flask is a lightweight Web Server Gateway Interface used for Python. It will allow me to create a friendly user interface capable of completing CRUD requests. It will also allow me to route to different pages on my website, using the @app.route command. 

## Pytest 

## Selenium

## Jinja2 and HTML

I will code my web-pages using HTML. 

## Git and Github 

## Jenkins 

## GCP Server
